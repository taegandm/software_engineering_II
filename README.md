# software_engineering_II
This is a repository for work related to my software engineering II project. It started empty but we created a new branch called **new_branch** where we could make some changes before commiting them.

## Changes Made
The only file we added was *hello_world.java* which included the classic "Hello World!" text and a message printing what assignment this is for. The code looked something like this:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World!");
  System.out.print("This is for class assignment 3\n");
}
```
Hope you enjoyed this first repository!
